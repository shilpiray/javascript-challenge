# UFO-sightings-JavaScript-and-DOM-Manipulation

Used the ufo dataset provided in the form of a JavaScript object, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Made sure, columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least. Added an input tag to the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
